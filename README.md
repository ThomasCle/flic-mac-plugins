# Flic Mac Plugins

This is my personal repository of useful Flic plugins for Mac. Hopefully others might find them usefull too.

The plugins are supposed to be used with the official [Flic Mac App](https://flic.io/mac-app).

Feel free to request plugins or make them yourself and create a pull-request 🙌🏻

## Plugins

* Show the screensaver (and lock your Mac)
* Open the Xcode iOS Simulator location in Finder.
* Reminders with voice or alerts 🚨
* Play _very important_ sounds 🔉

## Installation

Run the `install-all-plugins.sh` script to move all the plugins to the right location. Restart the Flic Mac application. Start adding the plugins as actions! 🚀
